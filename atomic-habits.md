## 1. The Power of Atomic Habits
Habits seem to make little difference on any given day, and yet the impact they deliver over the months/years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two/five/ten years later, that the value of good habits, and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.

Success is the product of daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformations. It doesn't matter how successful/unsuccessful you are right now. What matters, is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory, than with your current results.

Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.

Productivity compounds. Accomplishing one extra task is a small feat on any given day, but it counts for a lot over an entire career. The effect of automating an old task, or mastering a new skill, can be even greater. The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas.

Knowledge compounds. Learning one new idea won't make you a genius, but a commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative.

Relationships compound. People reflect your behavior back to you. The more you help others, the more others want to help you. Being a little bit nicer in each interaction, can result in a network of broad/strong connections over time.

The most powerful outcomes are delayed. Habits often appear to make no difference, until you cross a critical threshold, and unlock a new level of performance. In the early and middle stages of any quest, there are often disappointments. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion, and it's frustrating how ineffective changes can seem, during the first days/weeks/months. To make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through the plateau.

Complaining about not achieving success, despite working hard, is like complaining about an ice cube not melting, when you heated it from 25 to 31 degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at 32 degrees.

The outside world only sees the most dramatic event, rather than all that preceded it. But you know that, it's the work you did long ago - when it seemed that you weren't making any progress - that makes the jump today possible.

Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals - focus on your system instead.

Imagine you have a messy room, and you set a goal to clean it. If you summon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room - for now. But if you maintain the same sloppy habits that led to a messy room in the first place, soon you'll be looking at a new pile of clutter, and hoping for another burst of motivation. You're left chasing the same outcome, because you never changed the system behind it. You treated a symptom only, without addressing the cause.

A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process, rather than the product, you don't have to wait to see the big results. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.

When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward, after you achieve it? True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It's not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process, that will determine your progress.
