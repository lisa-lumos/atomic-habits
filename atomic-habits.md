# Atomic habits          
## 1. The Power of Atomic Habits
Habits seem to make little difference on any given day, and yet the impact they deliver over the months/years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two/five/ten years later, that the value of good habits, and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.

Success is the product of daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformations. It doesn't matter how successful/unsuccessful you are right now. What matters, is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory, than with your current results.

Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.

Productivity compounds. Accomplishing one extra task is a small feat on any given day, but it counts for a lot over an entire career. The effect of automating an old task, or mastering a new skill, can be even greater. The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas.

Knowledge compounds. Learning one new idea won't make you a genius, but a commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative.

Relationships compound. People reflect your behavior back to you. The more you help others, the more others want to help you. Being a little bit nicer in each interaction, can result in a network of broad/strong connections over time.

The most powerful outcomes are delayed. Habits often appear to make no difference, until you cross a critical threshold, and unlock a new level of performance. In the early and middle stages of any quest, there are often disappointments. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion, and it's frustrating how ineffective changes can seem, during the first days/weeks/months. To make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through the plateau.

Complaining about not achieving success, despite working hard, is like complaining about an ice cube not melting, when you heated it from 25 to 31 degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at 32 degrees.

The outside world only sees the most dramatic event, rather than all that preceded it. But you know that, it's the work you did long ago - when it seemed that you weren't making any progress - that makes the jump today possible.

Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals - focus on your system instead.

Imagine you have a messy room, and you set a goal to clean it. If you summon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room - for now. But if you maintain the same sloppy habits that led to a messy room in the first place, soon you'll be looking at a new pile of clutter, and hoping for another burst of motivation. You're left chasing the same outcome, because you never changed the system behind it. You treated a symptom only, without addressing the cause.

A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process, rather than the product, you don't have to wait to see the big results. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.

When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward, after you achieve it? True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It's not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process, that will determine your progress.

## 2. How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.

The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.

True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you'll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity. For example: 
- The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.
- The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.
- The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.

The author of the book didn't start out as a writer - he became one through his habits.

Every action you take, is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity.

It doesn't matter if you cast a few votes for a bad behavior or an unproductive habit. Your goal is simply to win the majority of the time.

Once you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you can begin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity. I have a friend who lost over 100 pounds by asking herself, "What would a healthy person do?" All day long, she would use this question as a guide. Would a healthy person walk or take a cab? Would a healthy person order a burrito or a salad? She figured if she acted like a healthy person long enough, eventually she would become that person.

Ultimately, your habits matter, because they help you become the type of person you wish to be. Quite literally, you become your habits.

## 3. How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
Behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated, and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.

A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.

As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases. Your brain skips the process of trial and error and creates a mental rule: if this, then that.

Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.

It's only by making the fundamentals of life easier, that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity.

Building habits in the present, allows you to do more of what you want in the future.

The habit loop: cue, craving, response, reward; cue, craving, response, reward - that ultimately allows you to create automatic habits. 

How to Create a Good Habit: 
- The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.
- The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive. 
- The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy. 
- The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.

## 4. The Man Who Didn't Look Right
Your ability to notice the relevant cues in a given situation, is the foundation for every habit you have.

You don't need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin.

Once a habit is firmly rooted in your life, it is mostly non-conscious and automatic. Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life, and you will call it fate.

Pointing-and-Calling is so effective, because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit, to a more conscious level.

Ask your self: Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be?

Examples: 
- If you waste time online, notice that you are spending your life in a way that you do not want to.
- If you want to cut back on your junk food habit, but notice yourself grabbing another cookie, say out loud, "I'm about to eat this cookie, but I don't need it. Eating it will cause me to gain weight and hurt my health."

This approach is useful even if you're simply trying to remember a task on your to-do list.

## 5. The Best Way to Start a New Habit
Implementation intention: a plan you make beforehand, about when and where to act.

An implementation intention sweeps away foggy notions, and transforms them into a concrete plan of action.

The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence:
```
I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].
```

If you aren't sure when to start your habit, try the first day of the week/month/year. People are more likely to take action at those times, because hope is usually higher. If we have hope, we have a reason to take action. A fresh start feels motivating.

Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it, helps you say no to distractions that pull you off course.

The Diderot Effect: obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption, that leads to additional purchases.

No behavior happens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.

Habit stacking: identify a current habit you already do each day, and then stack your new behavior on top. 

The habit stacking formula is:
```
After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].
```

No matter how you use this strategy, the secret to creating a successful habit stack, is selecting the right cue to kick things off.

Habit stacking works best, when the cue is highly specific, and immediately actionable.

Be specific and clear: After I close the door. After I brush my teeth. After I sit down at the table. The specificity is important.

## 6. Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More
Your habits change depending on the room you are in, and the cues in front of you.

Every habit is context dependent.

Many of the actions we take each day, are shaped NOT by purposeful drive and choice, but by the most obvious option.

The most powerful of all human sensory abilities, is vision. Creating obvious visual cues, can draw your attention toward a desired habit.

The most persistent behaviors usually have multiple cues. 

Making a better decision is easy and natural, when the cues for good habits are right in front of you.

Over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger, but with the entire context surrounding the behavior.

Habits can be easier to change in a new environment.

The mantra I find useful is "One space, one use."

## 7. The Secret to Self-Control
"Disciplined" people are better at structuring their lives in a way, that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations.

You can break a habit, but you are unlikely to forget it. 

One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit, is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.

Make the cues of bad habits invisible. If you are spending too much money on electronics, quit reading reviews of the latest tech gear.

Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one - your energy should be spent on optimizing your environment. Make the cues of your good habits obvious, and the cues of your bad habits invisible.

## 8. How to Make a Habit Irresistible
Supernormal stimuli: The brain of each animal is preloaded with certain rules for behavior, and when it comes across an exaggerated version of that rule, it lights up like a Christmas tree. 

The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.

Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act. It is the anticipation of a reward, not the fulfillment of it, that gets us to take action. So we need to make our habits attractive. 

Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do, with an action you need to do. You're more likely to find a behavior attractive, if you get to do one of your favorite things at the same time.

## 9. The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits
We imitate the habits of three groups in particular:
1. The close. We soak up the qualities and practices of those around us. Surround yourself with people who have the habits, that you want to have yourself. Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior, and you already have something in common with the group. Being a part of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits.
2. The many. The reward of being accepted, is often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart, or finding truth. Most days, we'd rather be wrong with the crowd, than be right by ourselves. When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive.
3. The powerful. We try to copy the behavior of successful people, because we desire success ourselves. We imitate people we envy.

## 10. How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits
Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits, rather than their drawbacks, is a fast/lightweight way to reprogram your mind, and make a habit seem more attractive.

## 11. Walk Slowly, but Never Backward 
It is easy to get stuck trying to find the "optimal" plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach, that we never get around to taking action. "The best" is the enemy of the good.

If planning doesn't lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do it because we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often, we do it, because planning allows us to feel like we are making progress, without running the risk of failure.

Planning makes you feel like you are getting things done. But really, you are just preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don't want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing.

If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection.

Repeating a habit leads to clear physical changes in the brain. Repetition is a form of change.

Habits form based on frequency, not time.

You need to string together enough successful attempts, until the behavior is firmly embedded in your mind, and you cross the Habit Line.

To build a habit, you need to practice it. And the most effective way to make practice happen, is to adhere to the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: make it easy. Which is talked about in the next chapters. 

## 12. The Law of Least Effort
Our real motivation is to be lazy, and to do what is convenient/easy.

The less energy a habit requires, the more likely it is to occur.

Habits are easier to build, when they fit into the flow of your life (aka, convenient/easy). You are more likely to go to the gym, if it is on your way to work, because stopping doesn't add much friction to your lifestyle. By comparison, if the gym is off the path of your normal commute, even by just a few blocks, you're going "out of your way" to get there.

The central idea, is to create an environment, where doing the right thing is as easy as possible: 
- If you want to cook a healthy breakfast, the night before, place the skillet on the stove, set the cooking spray on the counter, and lay out utensils you'll need. When you wake up, making breakfast will be easy.
- Want to improve your diet? Chop up a ton of fruits/vegetables on weekends, and pack them in containers, so you have easy access to healthy, ready-to-eat options during the week.

You can also invert this principle, and modify the environment to make bad behaviors difficult: 
- If you find yourself watching too much TV, then unplug it after each use. Only plug it back in, if you can say out loud the name of the show you want to watch. This setup creates just enough friction to prevent mindless viewing.
- If that doesn't do it, take it a step further. Unplug the TV, and take the batteries out of the remote after each use, so it takes an extra 10s to turn it back on. And if you're really hardcore, after each use, move the TV out of the living room into a closet. You can be sure you'll only take it out, when you really want to watch something. The greater the friction, the less likely the habit.

## 13. How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule
Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path, and before you know it, you're speeding toward this habit. It seems to be easier to continue what you are already doing, than to start doing something different.

Decisive moments: Every day, there are a handful of moments, that deliver an outsized impact. The difference between a good day and a bad day, is often a few productive and healthy choices, made at decisive moments.

When you start a new habit, it should take less than 2 min to do. Once you've started doing the right thing, it is much easier to continue doing it. What you want, is a "gateway habit", that naturally leads you down a more productive path.

A habit must be established, before it can be improved.

Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis. You have to standardize, before you can optimize.

It's better to do less than you hoped, than to do nothing at all.

Standardize before you optimize. You can't improve a habit that doesn't exist.

## 14. How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible
A commitment device is a choice you make in the present, that controls your actions in the future. It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones.

Commitment devices are useful, because they enable you to take advantage of good intentions, before you can fall victim to temptation.

The best way to break a bad habit, is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction, until you don't even have the option to act.

## 15. The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change
The first three laws of behavior change - make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy - increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change - make it satisfying - increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time. It completes the habit loop.

We always want immediate satisfaction.

The consequences of bad habits are delayed, while the rewards are immediate.

With bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad. 

With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good.

The costs of your good habits are in the present. The costs of your bad habits are in the future.

As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals.

What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.

Success in nearly every field, requires you to ignore an immediate reward, in favor of a delayed reward.

The best way to let yourself delay gratification, is to add a little bit of immediate pleasure to good habits, and a little bit of immediate pain to bad habits.

The vital thing in getting a habit to stick, is to feel successful - even if it's in a small way. The feeling of success is a signal that your habit paid of,f and that the work was worth the effort.

You want to make avoidance of bad habits visible. Open a savings account, and label it for something you want - maybe "Leather Jacket". Whenever you skip a purchase, put the same amount of money in the account. Skip your morning latte? Transfer $5. Pass on another month of Netflix? Move $10 over. The immediate reward of seeing yourself save money toward the leather jacket, feels a lot better than being deprived. You are making it satisfying to do nothing.

The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to follow through.

## 16. How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day
"Don't break the chain" is a powerful mantra.

Habit tracking helps keep your eye on the ball: you're focused on the process, rather than the result.

I try to remind myself of a simple rule: never miss twice. This principle is so important, that I'll stick to it, even if I can't do a habit as well as I wanted it. Too often, with our habits, we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle. The problem is not breaking the habit; the problem is thinking that if you can't do something perfectly, then you shouldn't do it at all.

The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.

The human mind wants to "win" whatever game is being played. We focus on working long hours, instead of getting meaningful work done. We care more about getting ten thousand steps, than we do about being healthy. We teach for standardized tests, instead of emphasizing learning/curiosity/critical-thinking. We optimize for what we measure. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior.

## 17. How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything
The more immediate the pain, the less likely the behavior. If you want to prevent bad habits, and eliminate unhealthy behaviors, then adding an instant cost to the action, is a great way to reduce their odds.

To be healthy, the cost of laziness must be greater than the cost of exercise. Getting fined for smoking in a restaurant, or failing to recycle, adds consequence to an action. Behavior shifts if the punishment is painful enough, and reliably enforced.

## 18. The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don't)
Until you work as hard as those you admire, don't explain away their success as luck.

## 19. The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work
The Goldilocks Rule: Humans experience peak motivation, when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.

Really successful people feel the same lack of motivation, as everyone else. The difference is that, they still find a way to show up, despite the feelings of boredom.

The greatest threat to success, is not failure, but boredom.

No habit will stay interesting forever. At some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self-improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom.

If you only do the work when it's convenient/exciting, then you will never be consistent enough to achieve remarkable results.

When a habit is truly important to you, you have to be willing to stick to it, in any mood. 

The only way to become excellent, is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.

Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It's the ability to keep going, when work isn't exciting, that makes the difference.

## 20. The Downside of Creating Good Habits
When you know the simple movements so well, that you can perform them without thinking, you are free to pay attention to more advanced details.

However, when you can do it "good enough" on autopilot, you stop thinking about how to do it better.

The upside of habits, is that we can do things without thinking. The downside of habits, is that you get used to doing things a certain way, and stop paying attention to little errors.

Habits are necessary, but not sufficient for mastery. What you need, is a combination of automatic habits, and deliberate practice:
```
Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery
```

Each habit unlocks the next level of performance. It's an endless cycle.

You need to remain conscious of your performance over time, so you can continue to refine/improve. How? Establish a system for reflection and review.

The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it. Avoid making any single aspect of your identity an overwhelming portion of who you are.

## Conclusion
Success is not a goal to reach, nor a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine.

The secret to getting results that last, is to never stop making improvements. It's remarkable what you can build, if you just don't stop.
