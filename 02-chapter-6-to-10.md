## 6. Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More
Your habits change depending on the room you are in, and the cues in front of you.

Every habit is context dependent.

Many of the actions we take each day, are shaped NOT by purposeful drive and choice, but by the most obvious option.

The most powerful of all human sensory abilities, is vision. Creating obvious visual cues, can draw your attention toward a desired habit.

The most persistent behaviors usually have multiple cues. 

Making a better decision is easy and natural, when the cues for good habits are right in front of you.

Over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger, but with the entire context surrounding the behavior.

Habits can be easier to change in a new environment.

The mantra I find useful is "One space, one use."

## 7. The Secret to Self-Control
"Disciplined" people are better at structuring their lives in a way, that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations.

You can break a habit, but you are unlikely to forget it. 

One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit, is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.

Make the cues of bad habits invisible. If you are spending too much money on electronics, quit reading reviews of the latest tech gear.

Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one - your energy should be spent on optimizing your environment. Make the cues of your good habits obvious, and the cues of your bad habits invisible.

## 8. How to Make a Habit Irresistible
Supernormal stimuli: The brain of each animal is preloaded with certain rules for behavior, and when it comes across an exaggerated version of that rule, it lights up like a Christmas tree. 

The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.

Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act. It is the anticipation of a reward, not the fulfillment of it, that gets us to take action. So we need to make our habits attractive. 

Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do, with an action you need to do. You're more likely to find a behavior attractive, if you get to do one of your favorite things at the same time.

## 9. The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits
We imitate the habits of three groups in particular:
1. The close. We soak up the qualities and practices of those around us. Surround yourself with people who have the habits, that you want to have yourself. Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior, and you already have something in common with the group. Being a part of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits.
2. The many. The reward of being accepted, is often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart, or finding truth. Most days, we'd rather be wrong with the crowd, than be right by ourselves. When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive.
3. The powerful. We try to copy the behavior of successful people, because we desire success ourselves. We imitate people we envy.
