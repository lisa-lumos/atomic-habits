## 16. How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day
"Don't break the chain" is a powerful mantra.

Habit tracking helps keep your eye on the ball: you're focused on the process, rather than the result.

I try to remind myself of a simple rule: never miss twice. This principle is so important, that I'll stick to it, even if I can't do a habit as well as I wanted it. Too often, with our habits, we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle. The problem is not breaking the habit; the problem is thinking that if you can't do something perfectly, then you shouldn't do it at all.

The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.

The human mind wants to "win" whatever game is being played. We focus on working long hours, instead of getting meaningful work done. We care more about getting ten thousand steps, than we do about being healthy. We teach for standardized tests, instead of emphasizing learning/curiosity/critical-thinking. We optimize for what we measure. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior.

## 17. How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything
The more immediate the pain, the less likely the behavior. If you want to prevent bad habits, and eliminate unhealthy behaviors, then adding an instant cost to the action, is a great way to reduce their odds.

To be healthy, the cost of laziness must be greater than the cost of exercise. Getting fined for smoking in a restaurant, or failing to recycle, adds consequence to an action. Behavior shifts if the punishment is painful enough, and reliably enforced.

Until you work as hard as those you admire, don't explain away their success as luck.

## 19. The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work
The Goldilocks Rule: Humans experience peak motivation, when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.

Really successful people feel the same lack of motivation, as everyone else. The difference is that, they still find a way to show up, despite the feelings of boredom.

The greatest threat to success, is not failure, but boredom.

No habit will stay interesting forever. At some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self-improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom.

If you only do the work when it's convenient/exciting, then you will never be consistent enough to achieve remarkable results.

When a habit is truly important to you, you have to be willing to stick to it, in any mood. 

The only way to become excellent, is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.

Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It's the ability to keep going, when work isn't exciting, that makes the difference.

## 20. The Downside of Creating Good Habits
When you know the simple movements so well, that you can perform them without thinking, you are free to pay attention to more advanced details.

However, when you can do it "good enough" on autopilot, you stop thinking about how to do it better.

The upside of habits, is that we can do things without thinking. The downside of habits, is that you get used to doing things a certain way, and stop paying attention to little errors.

Habits are necessary, but not sufficient for mastery. What you need, is a combination of automatic habits, and deliberate practice:
```
Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery
```

Each habit unlocks the next level of performance. It's an endless cycle.

You need to remain conscious of your performance over time, so you can continue to refine/improve. How? Establish a system for reflection and review.

The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it. Avoid making any single aspect of your identity an overwhelming portion of who you are.

## Conclusion
Success is not a goal to reach, nor a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine.

The secret to getting results that last, is to never stop making improvements. It's remarkable what you can build, if you just don't stop.
