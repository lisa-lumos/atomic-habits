## 11. Walk Slowly, but Never Backward 
It is easy to get stuck trying to find the "optimal" plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach, that we never get around to taking action. "The best" is the enemy of the good.

If planning doesn't lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do it because we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often, we do it, because planning allows us to feel like we are making progress, without running the risk of failure.

Planning makes you feel like you are getting things done. But really, you are just preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don't want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing.

If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection.

Repeating a habit leads to clear physical changes in the brain. Repetition is a form of change.

Habits form based on frequency, not time.

You need to string together enough successful attempts, until the behavior is firmly embedded in your mind, and you cross the Habit Line.

To build a habit, you need to practice it. And the most effective way to make practice happen, is to adhere to the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: make it easy. Which is talked about in the next chapters. 

## 12. The Law of Least Effort
Our real motivation is to be lazy, and to do what is convenient/easy.

The less energy a habit requires, the more likely it is to occur.

Habits are easier to build, when they fit into the flow of your life (aka, convenient/easy). You are more likely to go to the gym, if it is on your way to work, because stopping doesn't add much friction to your lifestyle. By comparison, if the gym is off the path of your normal commute, even by just a few blocks, you're going "out of your way" to get there.

The central idea, is to create an environment, where doing the right thing is as easy as possible: 
- If you want to cook a healthy breakfast, the night before, place the skillet on the stove, set the cooking spray on the counter, and lay out utensils you'll need. When you wake up, making breakfast will be easy.
- Want to improve your diet? Chop up a ton of fruits/vegetables on weekends, and pack them in containers, so you have easy access to healthy, ready-to-eat options during the week.

You can also invert this principle, and modify the environment to make bad behaviors difficult: 
- If you find yourself watching too much TV, then unplug it after each use. Only plug it back in, if you can say out loud the name of the show you want to watch. This setup creates just enough friction to prevent mindless viewing.
- If that doesn't do it, take it a step further. Unplug the TV, and take the batteries out of the remote after each use, so it takes an extra 10s to turn it back on. And if you're really hardcore, after each use, move the TV out of the living room into a closet. You can be sure you'll only take it out, when you really want to watch something. The greater the friction, the less likely the habit.

## 13. How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule
Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path, and before you know it, you're speeding toward this habit. It seems to be easier to continue what you are already doing, than to start doing something different.

Decisive moments: Every day, there are a handful of moments, that deliver an outsized impact. The difference between a good day and a bad day, is often a few productive and healthy choices, made at decisive moments.

When you start a new habit, it should take less than 2 min to do. Once you've started doing the right thing, it is much easier to continue doing it. What you want, is a "gateway habit", that naturally leads you down a more productive path.

A habit must be established, before it can be improved.

Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis. You have to standardize, before you can optimize.

It's better to do less than you hoped, than to do nothing at all.

Standardize before you optimize. You can't improve a habit that doesn't exist.

## 14. How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible
A commitment device is a choice you make in the present, that controls your actions in the future. It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones.

Commitment devices are useful, because they enable you to take advantage of good intentions, before you can fall victim to temptation.

The best way to break a bad habit, is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction, until you don't even have the option to act.

## 15. The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change
The first three laws of behavior change - make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy - increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change - make it satisfying - increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time. It completes the habit loop.

We always want immediate satisfaction.

The consequences of bad habits are delayed, while the rewards are immediate.

With bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad. 

With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good.

The costs of your good habits are in the present. The costs of your bad habits are in the future.

As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals.

What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.

Success in nearly every field, requires you to ignore an immediate reward, in favor of a delayed reward.

The best way to let yourself delay gratification, is to add a little bit of immediate pleasure to good habits, and a little bit of immediate pain to bad habits.

The vital thing in getting a habit to stick, is to feel successful - even if it's in a small way. The feeling of success is a signal that your habit paid of,f and that the work was worth the effort.

You want to make avoidance of bad habits visible. Open a savings account, and label it for something you want - maybe "Leather Jacket". Whenever you skip a purchase, put the same amount of money in the account. Skip your morning latte? Transfer $5. Pass on another month of Netflix? Move $10 over. The immediate reward of seeing yourself save money toward the leather jacket, feels a lot better than being deprived. You are making it satisfying to do nothing.

The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to follow through.
