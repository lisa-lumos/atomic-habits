## 1. The Power of Atomic Habits
Habits seem to make little difference on any given day, and yet the impact they deliver over the months/years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two/five/ten years later, that the value of good habits, and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.

Success is the product of daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformations. It doesn't matter how successful/unsuccessful you are right now. What matters, is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory, than with your current results.

Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.

Productivity compounds. Accomplishing one extra task is a small feat on any given day, but it counts for a lot over an entire career. The effect of automating an old task, or mastering a new skill, can be even greater. The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas.

Knowledge compounds. Learning one new idea won't make you a genius, but a commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative.

Relationships compound. People reflect your behavior back to you. The more you help others, the more others want to help you. Being a little bit nicer in each interaction, can result in a network of broad/strong connections over time.

The most powerful outcomes are delayed. Habits often appear to make no difference, until you cross a critical threshold, and unlock a new level of performance. In the early and middle stages of any quest, there are often disappointments. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion, and it's frustrating how ineffective changes can seem, during the first days/weeks/months. To make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through the plateau.

Complaining about not achieving success, despite working hard, is like complaining about an ice cube not melting, when you heated it from 25 to 31 degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at 32 degrees.

The outside world only sees the most dramatic event, rather than all that preceded it. But you know that, it's the work you did long ago - when it seemed that you weren't making any progress - that makes the jump today possible.

Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals - focus on your system instead.

Imagine you have a messy room, and you set a goal to clean it. If you summon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room - for now. But if you maintain the same sloppy habits that led to a messy room in the first place, soon you'll be looking at a new pile of clutter, and hoping for another burst of motivation. You're left chasing the same outcome, because you never changed the system behind it. You treated a symptom only, without addressing the cause.

A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process, rather than the product, you don't have to wait to see the big results. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.

When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward, after you achieve it? True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It's not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process, that will determine your progress.

## 2. How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.

The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.

True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you'll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity. For example: 
- The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.
- The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.
- The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.

The author of the book didn't start out as a writer - he became one through his habits.

Every action you take, is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity.

It doesn't matter if you cast a few votes for a bad behavior or an unproductive habit. Your goal is simply to win the majority of the time.

Once you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you can begin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity. I have a friend who lost over 100 pounds by asking herself, "What would a healthy person do?" All day long, she would use this question as a guide. Would a healthy person walk or take a cab? Would a healthy person order a burrito or a salad? She figured if she acted like a healthy person long enough, eventually she would become that person.

Ultimately, your habits matter, because they help you become the type of person you wish to be. Quite literally, you become your habits.

## 3. How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
Behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated, and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.

A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.

As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases. Your brain skips the process of trial and error and creates a mental rule: if this, then that.

Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.

It's only by making the fundamentals of life easier, that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity.

Building habits in the present, allows you to do more of what you want in the future.

The habit loop: cue, craving, response, reward; cue, craving, response, reward - that ultimately allows you to create automatic habits. 

How to Create a Good Habit: 
- The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.
- The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive. 
- The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy. 
- The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.

## 4. The Man Who Didn't Look Right
Your ability to notice the relevant cues in a given situation, is the foundation for every habit you have.

You don't need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin.

Once a habit is firmly rooted in your life, it is mostly non-conscious and automatic. Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life, and you will call it fate.

Pointing-and-Calling is so effective, because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit, to a more conscious level.

Ask your self: Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be?

Examples: 
- If you waste time online, notice that you are spending your life in a way that you do not want to.
- If you want to cut back on your junk food habit, but notice yourself grabbing another cookie, say out loud, "I'm about to eat this cookie, but I don't need it. Eating it will cause me to gain weight and hurt my health."

This approach is useful even if you're simply trying to remember a task on your to-do list.

## 5. The Best Way to Start a New Habit
Implementation intention: a plan you make beforehand, about when and where to act.

An implementation intention sweeps away foggy notions, and transforms them into a concrete plan of action.

The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence:
```
I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].
```

If you aren't sure when to start your habit, try the first day of the week/month/year. People are more likely to take action at those times, because hope is usually higher. If we have hope, we have a reason to take action. A fresh start feels motivating.

Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it, helps you say no to distractions that pull you off course.

The Diderot Effect: obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption, that leads to additional purchases.

No behavior happens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.

Habit stacking: identify a current habit you already do each day, and then stack your new behavior on top. 

The habit stacking formula is:
```
After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].
```

No matter how you use this strategy, the secret to creating a successful habit stack, is selecting the right cue to kick things off.

Habit stacking works best, when the cue is highly specific, and immediately actionable.

Be specific and clear: After I close the door. After I brush my teeth. After I sit down at the table. The specificity is important.
